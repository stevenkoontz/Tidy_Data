# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The goal of this project is to show the ability to get and clean data using R.

This project includes a script that will produce a tidy data set called tidydata.csv. This data set combines all mean and standard deviation measurements for the provided test and train data . It final data set contains 10,299 rows and 68 variables in this data set. 

The script also produces another file called average.cvs. This file finds the mean of each variable for each activity. There are 180 rows and 68 variables in this data set. 

The following is how to script works:
<ul>
  <li>Loads all the data into R</li>
    <li>Merges the data together step by step</li>
    <li>Loads all the data into R</li>
    <li>Selects the mean and standard deviation measurements and creats clean column names</li>
    <li>Creates activity lables</li>
    <li>Combines all the data together</li>
    <li>Writes out a CSV which all the tidy data</li>
    <li>Creates averages for the activies</li>
    <li>Writes out an averages CSV</li>
  <li>Writes out an averages text file for uploading to coursera</li>
  
  
</ul>
